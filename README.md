SQL Injection is a type of cyber attack that targets web applications by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, such as login forms or search boxes. The purpose of this attack is to manipulate the database, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data without proper authorization. During my cybersecurity training, I learned that SQL Injection can be used to bypass authentication, extract user credentials, or even gain administrative access to a system. For example, by entering ' OR '1'='1 into a login field, an attacker might trick the system into granting access without a valid password. Understanding SQL Injection is important for building secure applications and learning how to protect them using techniques like input validation, prepared statements, and web application firewalls (WAFs).
